Best Practice:
 function bonusTime(salary, bonus) {
  return bonus ? `£${10 * salary}` : `£${salary}`;
 } 

Debrief:

My first two attempts are essentially the same. What I like about the second is that its nice and clean

First, it uses a ternary operator to do if...else

Next, it uses template literal to have placeholders for Salary

I found out that template literals can actually hold not just a variable, but also mathematical operations, which cleaned
things up nicely. My refactored solution it uses a ternary operator to check if/else then displays the salary either
multiplied by 10 (if true) or just the salary(if false)

Even better - the best practices is very close to mine except I use salary * = 10 while best practices uses 10 * salary

The neatest thing is finding out I can use mathematical operations in template literal placeholders :D
