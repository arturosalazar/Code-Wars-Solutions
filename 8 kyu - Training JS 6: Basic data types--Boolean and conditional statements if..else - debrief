Best Practice - 
function trueOrFalse(val){
  return Boolean(val).toString();
} 

Debrief - 
This one was a little weird - it already solved itself...which was kinda a bummer.

However there were some interesting things for me to note. In particular, how to write a boolean statement that can check 
for multiple possibilities
You can use the || operator (OR operator) to separate different boolean tests like val === false or val === null
That way, if either of these are true, then the whole thing returns to true

You can also use the && operator in the same way except in this instance, EACH side of the operator has to be true for 
the whole thing to return true 


I thought the best practices one looks nice
It takes the value and coerces it explicitly into a boolean value using the Boolean() object wrapper 
THEN it runs the toString(); method on that value, which takes the boolean and returns either "true" or "false",
which is exactly what the requirements were. Very clean and nice.
