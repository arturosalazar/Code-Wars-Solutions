Best Practice:
function animal(obj){
  return `This ${obj.color} ${obj.name} has ${obj.legs} legs.`;
}

Debrief:

The best practices version makes use of a really nice feature called template literals

It allows you to create strings using backticks (`) instead of single (') or double (") quotes

The nice feature of using template literals is that you can use placeholders ${} that you can use in template literals 
that allow you to "nest a variable inside a string without doing concatenation using the + operator"
