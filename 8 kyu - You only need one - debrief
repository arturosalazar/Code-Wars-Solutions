Best Practice:

function check(a,x){
  return a.includes(x);
}; 

Debrief:

From MDN 

"The includes() method determines whether an array includes a certain element, returning true or false as appropriate. It uses the sameValueZero algorithm to determine whether the given element is found."



This is pretty cool - I did this whole big thing where I check to see if an array contains a variable by running forEach over the whole thing.



IN FACT - there is a method that will check an array to see if it includes whatever you pass to includes()

From MDN (again)
"
Syntax 
  arr.includes(searchElement[, fromIndex])

Parameters
  searchElement
    The element to search for.
  fromIndex (Optional)
    The position in this array at which to begin searching for searchElement. A negative value searches from the index of array.length - fromIndex by asc. Defaults to 0.

Return value
  A Boolean.

Neat
